# Kaggle March Madness 2019 Solution

This is my solution for the 2019 session of the so-called "March Madness" basketball tournament. I made a submission for women as well as for men. The models are similar for both but there are a few differences. To run this solution yourself you'll want to want to put the data available from Kaggle and dump it in the appropriate directory. For example for women you can download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/womens-machine-learning-competition-2019/data) and dump it in the `data/women` directory. Likewise there is one notebook for women, and one for men. The notebook isn't heavy on comments but I made a point of writing idiomatic and readable code, so you shouldn't have too much difficulty in understanding it.

Here are my predicted brackets for women (made with [bracketeer](https://github.com/cshaley/bracketeer/)):

And here they are for men:
